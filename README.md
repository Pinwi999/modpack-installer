It will then also display the information of that .mrpack file\

Then go to the `Launcher` tab <img width="895" height="667" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45ccc786-f5a0-4c64-bc1c-4d9e241d25b1" />

Select your Minecraft launcher and installation, or make a new installation by pressing `New Installation` and giving it a name at `Installation Name`

(Also if you didn't install your minecraft at the default install path, then you will have to type the path you saved it at)

Then, go to the `Install` tab <img width="894" height="662" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86ef4204-f90a-4ce6-8b60-fc5b6a5667a0" />

You can choose to `Overwrite existing mods`, `Keep existing config files`, and `Create a backup before installing`.

Once you have done all of these steps, click install and it will install your mods! <img width="901" height="661" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/666fb6f8-b492-423b-b999-40bcdc3082fa" />
